# Django-Online-Shop
*An online shop made using Django*

This is a completely original Django project made by Kristen Martin. It's an online surf/diving store named The Sea Wolf.

This website features:
* User accounts and authentication
* Products and categories
* A callable REST API that returns product information
* Cart and checkout process
* Shipping time/cost estimate using the ShipEngine API
* Product Reviews
* Orders and order history

I have deployed this project to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk, an RDS PostgreSQL server, and an S3 bucket to manage media and static files.
