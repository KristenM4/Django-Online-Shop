# Django-Online-Shop
An online shop made using Django

This is an original Django project; an online shop featured products, categories, user accounts, a cart, and checkout process. 
I have deployed this project to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk, an RDS PostgreSQL server, and an S3 bucket to manage media and static files.
